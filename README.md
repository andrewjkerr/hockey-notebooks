# hockey-notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks using hockey statistics to learn how to do some analysis with Python.

## Installation & Setup (macOS)

Requirements: You'll need Python3 installed from Homebrew for these instructions (which, at least, the first two instructions come from [Homebrew's Python documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python) :p).

1. Upgrade `setuptools`: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools`
1. Upgrade `pip`: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`
1. Install `jupyterlab`: `python3 -m pip install jupyterlab`
1. Install `TopDownHockey_Scraper`: `python3 -m pip install TopDownHockey_Scraper`

### Using JupyterLab UI

1. Start the server: `python3 -m jupyterlab`
1. Use the in-browser JupyterLab!

### Using VSCode

The VSCode documentation explains how to use Jupyter notebooks: [Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)
